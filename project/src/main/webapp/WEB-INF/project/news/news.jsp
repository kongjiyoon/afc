				the best in the world.” Rio Ferdinand told ITV <br />

				<div style="font-weight: bolder; font-size: 25pt;">Frenkie de
					Jong</div>

				Barcelona know they have a special player on their hands. De Jong
				helped Ajax to an Eredivisie and cup double last season, while being
				named the league's best player, all at the age of 21. Now 22, the
				elegant Dutch midfielder is ready to embark on his first La Liga
				campaign. <br />
				<br /> "It's important for Barça to have players like De Jong. With
				his talent, at his age, he could become a Xavi or an Iniesta.
				[Barcelona] have to bring through their own players and mix them
				with good players from elsewhere. De Jong's not Messi, there's only
				one [Messi]. But he's a player that fits in really well at Barça.
				I'm excited to see him there next season." Ajax Director of Football
				Marc Overmars, in an interview with VTV Uruguay <br />
				<br /> <span style="font-weight: bolder;">The stat</span>: Over six
				UEFA Nations League matches, De Jong made 462 passes with a 93.3 per
				cent average pass completion rate and made five key passes, leading
				the Netherlands to the final where they were edged by Portugal.

				Ligt is mature beyond his years. He led Ajax to a league and cup
				double and their first UEFA Champions League semi-final since 1997.
				<br />
				<br /> "I am similar to [Pique]. I like to carry the ball out from
				the back. Defensively I am strong and, like Gerard, I also started
				as a midfielder." <br />De Ligttold ELF Voetbal Magazine <br />
				<br /> <span style="font-weight: bolder;">The stat</span>: Last
				season De Ligt became the first teenager with ten Champions League

				Chelsea career by bringing them a UEFA Europa League title, while he
				finished the 2018/19 season as the club's top goalscorer in all
				competitions. <br />
				<br /> "Hazard is the star of the future. He is very good and will
				get even better. I would bring him to Real Madrid with my eyes
				closed." <br />Real Madrid manager Zinedine Zidane, in an interview
				with MARCA back in 2010 <br />
				<br /> <span style="font-weight: bolder;">The stat</span>: Hazard is

				Mane, but the greatest achievements had to be winning the UEFA
				Champions League with Liverpool and finishing as the Premier
				League's joint-top goalscorer. <br />
				<br /> "Sadio is coming to an age where things are becoming more
				natural for him. He’s not having to convince people now. We all know

				Mbappe. The French prodigy also finished as Paris Saint-Germain's
				top goalscorer in all competitions last season. <br />

				La Liga title in the 2018/19 season, and Barcelona's eighth in 11
				years. <br />
				<br /> "Messi reserves the first minutes of each match for
				interpretation. Then, as the game advances, he gets in little by
				little. But by now he knows perfectly where the rivals’ weaknesses
				are. During that time he ignores the ball and takes a walk around
				the opposition defence, fixing each man's position in his head." <br />Barcelona
				manager Ernesto Valverde reveals one of Messi's secrets in an
				interview with The Financial Times <br />
				<br /> <span style="font-weight: bolder;">The stat</span> En route

				finished as joint-top goalscorer in the Premier League. He won the
				award outright in 2017/18. <br />

				mentality you need." <br />Liverpool manager Klopp <br />
				<br /> <span style="font-weight: bolder;">The stat</span> Salah

				title, while the centre-back was also named PFA and Premier League
				player of the year. <br />
				<br /> "He reminds me very much of Mark Lawrenson and Alan Hansen
				back in the day. They made everything look simple and he is the
				same. Good players always improve too." <br />Sammy Lee, former
				assistant coach of Van Dijk's at Southampton <br />
